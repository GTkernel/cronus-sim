# Cronus: Computer Vision-based Machine Intelligent Hybrid Memory Management

## Run Cronus
```
python run_cronus.py
```
### Visualized Memory Access Patterns and Pattern Detection
Under the folder `images/`.

This repo also contains the following code:
- `hmem_sim/` includes the hybrid memory simulation created in Cori and validated against an Intel Optane PMEM platform.
- `traces/` includes memory access traces generated for Cori and visualised with Cronus.
